# Lolly: a user-friendly C++ standard library alternative
## What
Lolly is C++ standard library extracted from GNU TeXmacs. It is the foundation of GNU TeXmacs, and it provides the C++ standard string and containers alternative.

## Why
For XmacsLabs, Lolly is created for the following reasons:
+ it serves as the warm-up project for new Mogan Developers with
  - Documentation of Lolly in doxygen format and available online
  - Documentation of how to develop lolly which is the subset of how to develop Mogan Editor
  - Well designed unit tests as re-usable code snippets
  - Code formatting and static checking
+ it is the frontier of multi-platform support, especially for wasm and windows
+ it is also the foundation of modularizing GNU TeXmacs

## Getting Started
Documentation is still WIP.
